Magic Prompt:
```
I would like you to develop a new magical trick using a standard deck of 52 cards. The trick involves a spectator selecting a card, with the magician subsequently determining which card was chosen.

To validate this trick, you must demonstrate that it is consistently effective. You may incorporate established techniques, but it is essential to introduce at least one novel method that no magician has previously used. This new method must be reliable.

An unsuitable example would be: shuffle the deck, remember the bottom card, have the spectator pick a card, place it beneath the remembered key card, perform multiple cuts, and then spread the cards to secretly observe the chosen card. This example is flawed for several reasons:

 1.⁠ ⁠It relies solely on a familiar technique (key cards) without integrating any new methods.
 2.⁠ ⁠It lacks comprehensive detail. A good magic trick should be meticulously explained, leaving no room for vague or omitted steps.
 3.⁠ ⁠The method is easily discernible. Methods that are either transparent or too similar to existing ones are deemed inadequate.

Now, I invite you to create an exemplary trick that includes an innovative method.
