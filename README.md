# Why it matters?

The essence of these tests is to push beyond the current boundaries of AI, challenging it to demonstrate not just technical proficiency or the ability to replicate human-generated content, but to exhibit genuine originality and innovation.

## Creative Capacity and Limitations
A central concern is AI's current limitations in creativity. Despite its ability to generate content, AI often seems tethered to the inputs it receives from humans.

The real test of AI's progression lies in its capacity to break free from these constraints and to produce work that is not just a reflection of existing human ideas, but something distinctly novel and innovative.

This raises fundamental questions about the nature of creativity in machines: Can AI transcend its programming to become a truly creative entity?

For example, given the prompt "an avocado chair" to an human or AI, the same type of ideas appear: an avocado looking chair, a chair made of avocado, a chair based on avocado colors, a chair with the design of a famous designer but with avocado influence.

Those ideals are not novel and are mere new implementations of creativity patterns well know to humans. Current AI is capable of accelerating the implementation of such creativity patterns by creating hundreds of such images in a short amount of time.

But there are no new patterns. Designers and non-designers do not recognize anything "new".

## What is new?


# Application in Science and Magic, and Practical Applications in Medicine and Art
Silveira's tests in the realms of science, magic, and art are designed to examine whether AI can indeed transcend the role of a sophisticated mimic.

By challenging AI to create a new scientific theory, invent a magic trick, or conceive a piece of art that defies current human capabilities, these tests aim to probe the very depths of AI's creative and intellectual prowess.

These challenges are not mere academic exercises but have real-world implications, for example in fields like medicine, where AI's ability to innovate could lead to groundbreaking treatments and cures.

## Why are the implications huge?

If humans recognize the output of such tests as new, even if a very small novelty in their results is found, it implies that given enough time, the AI will generate more and more novelty items.

This would be another huge step in AI achievements.

# The tests

The introduction of the Silveira Test marks a significant shift in evaluating AI. Moving beyond the Turing Test, which primarily assesses whether an AI can imitate human behavior convincingly, the Silveira Test sets a higher bar. It asks whether AI can originate something fundamentally new, be it in thought, art, or science. This test is not just about fooling a human into believing they are interacting with another human; it's about surpassing human creativity, leading to outputs that are not just novel but are also beyond what humans have so far conceived.

AI benchmarks that are based on human created tests are only testing the capacity of AI to mimic current human knowledge, not creativity capacity. Silveira's tests aim for something else.

The motivation for these tests is rooted in a visionary approach to AI's potential. It's about harnessing AI's computational power and learning capabilities to venture into realms of creativity and innovation that have, until now, been exclusively human domains.

By doing so, these tests aim to redefine the boundaries of AI and set new benchmarks for what intelligent machines can achieve.


### Why is it so difficult to create something new?

Guilherme Silveira's guess is that on the long run, generative methods converge to human stablished patterns - even if randomness is into play.

Human stablished patterns are already stablished, they are not new.

There might be a sweet spot of randomness that allows a generative AI to create something considered new.

While this sweet spot is not found, generated artifacts converge to previously created human patterns, even if the artifact itself is new. The avocado chair was never drawn before, but it is exactly what we expect from an avocado chair.


## Magic creation test

We want to check if the AI is capable of creating a new magic method for a magical performance. You can do as much prompt engineering as you wish, since the goal is to show the AI is capable of generating a new method.
You can not create a new method and insert it into the prompt to guide the result.

### Prompt example

I would like you to develop a new magical trick using a standard deck of 52 cards. The trick involves a spectator selecting a card, with the magician subsequently determining which card was chosen.

To validate this trick, you must demonstrate that it is consistently effective. You may incorporate established techniques, but it is essential to introduce at least one novel method that no magician has previously used. This new method must be reliable.

An unsuitable example would be: shuffle the deck, remember the bottom card, have the spectator pick a card, place it beneath the remembered key card, perform multiple cuts, and then spread the cards to secretly observe the chosen card. This example is flawed for several reasons:

 1.⁠ ⁠It relies solely on a familiar technique (key cards) without integrating any new methods.
 2.⁠ ⁠It lacks comprehensive detail. A good magic trick should be meticulously explained, leaving no room for vague or omitted steps.
 3.⁠ ⁠The method is easily discernible. Methods that are either transparent or too similar to existing ones are deemed inadequate.

Now, I invite you to create an exemplary trick that includes an innovative method.

### First check: novelty human check

1. The most common result: if the methods used do not work, it is a fail.
2. If the methods used are known to professional magicians, it is a fail.

The common result is a magic effect that shuffles a deck of cards after a card has been chosen, losing the card completely. Then the magician reveals the card: an impossibility.
The second most common failure is the usage of a method that is widely known, such as using marked cards.
The third most common failure is to use a method that is now widely know, such as using UV light with marked cards.

### Second check: is it considered magic?

A magician should perform the magic effect several times to different spectators, and also another effect that was not AI generated. The spectators should not be able to distinguish the AI generated one from the human created one.
